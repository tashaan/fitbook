Our goal is to allow CrossFit athletes to keep track of past workouts as well as personal records for each exercise. Our main features are the customizable calendar and workout statistics pages.

With a simple and user-friendly design, our athletes are able to add, modify, and remove workouts, which will be dynamically updated on the site. Your personal information will be stored on Google's Datastore and will be securely monitored by Google's App Engine. Additionally, users are allowed to create custom workouts to further personalize their calendars.

Through data analysis, detailed statistics are produced by our server to display graphs that plot personal records and provide data mapping workout progress and improvements.
